It turns out that using tools to make other tools out of metal requires lots of look-up tables and repetitive calculations. Computers are better at this than humans, so why not let them have all of the fun?

This repository builds JSON blobs for consumption by an unreleased android app built for my personal use. Dimensions are in microns, microns/second, revolutions/second, etc. as appropriate. Future data will expand to cover surface speeds and chiploads.

All data here is most-likely in the public domain - use it at your own risk.
